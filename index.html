    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m a web developer with a degree in Information Technology and hands-on experience building real-world solutions â€” including a complete payroll system for a corporate client using advanced Excel. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science to deepen my expertise in data-driven technologies and analytics. At the same time, I work as a logistician for an international logistics company, where I bring both my technical and operational skills to the table. This rare blend of IT, data, and logistics experience gives me a unique edge in solving complex, cross-functional problems with smart, scalable digital solutions.</p>

        <p><strong>Project Title: Payroll System with inbuilt Tax Bands & Payslip Generator</strong>
<p>Designed and implemented a robust payroll system in Microsoft Excel tailored for small-to-medium-sized businesses. The system featured inbuilt tax bands to automatically calculate income tax and statutory deductions based on employee earnings. It also generated individual payslips with detailed breakdowns of gross pay, deductions, and net salary, formatted for easy printing and record-keeping.

Leveraged advanced Excel functionalities including nested formulas, lookup functions (VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP), conditional formatting, and macros to automate the payroll workflow. The system significantly improved payroll accuracy, ensured compliance with tax regulations, and saved time for HR and finance teams.</p>
